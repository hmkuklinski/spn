# Supernatural Lore

This website was created to provide information to Supernatural fans at any point in their viewing journey. This website has different information about the episodes, the season, characters, monsters, and sigils. As well as fun features like a featured episode, character, and monster. There's also additional information about projects outside of Supernatural, including Podcasts, Conventions, Extras (In Progress) and Music (In Progress).

# The Home Page

If there is a featured section item you'd like to explore, just click the button and it will redirect you!

# The Journey- Episodes
<img width="1332" height="633" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-15 210818" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d2383c5-5f4e-44a2-af74-606da42bd6ac" />

This is the season selection menu. If you have a specific season you'd like to view, you can click on the titlecard of that season and it will redirect you. Otherwise, you can simly scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the right arrow button.

## Episodes- Preview
<img width="1267" height="613" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-01 143246" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2c7acaa-5cdf-452b-a399-41009e4fef00" />

You can scroll down the page to see all the episodes present in the season. Each episode has a photo preview from the episode, its title, and a short description. 

### Learn More About the Episode
<img width="1184" height="600" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-11 014453" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9376ed90-6157-4b01-b55e-942c1575032e" />

Simply click on the episode you'd like to learn more about and a separate pop up box will appear. This pop up gives you information about the director and writer of the episode. To exit, you can simply click the red X at the top right of the popup.

### How to Navigate
There are two ways that you can navigate through this section. The first way includes using the arrows on the bottom of each page. Using the arrow on the left page will go to the previous season (if season1 selected, will direct to the selection method) and the arrow on the right page will go to the next season (if season15 is selected, will direct you to the redirect page and photo gallery). This method is ideal if you would like to look at seasons that are close to the selected/current seasons.

The second way includes using the season dropdown option. At the top of the left page where it says what the current season is, you can simply click on either the word or the dropdown arrow. It will open the dropdown menu, which will allow you to select your season. This way is ideal if you want to view a later season or skip seasons you are viewing.

# Seasons
The menu for the season information is the same as the episodes. If you have a specific season you'd like to view, you can click on the titlecard of that season and it will redirect you. Otherwise, you can simly scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the right arrow button.

Each season will have basic information about the writers/directors, a quick summary about the plot line, the IMBd rating, the number of episodes, the release year, and the number of deaths in the season.
The right page will display the new characters that are introduced that season by default. The major character deaths are hidden by default to avoid spoiling newer fans.

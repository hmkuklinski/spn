### How to Navigate
There are two ways that you can navigate through this section. The first way includes using the arrows on the bottom of each page. Using the arrow on the left page will go to the previous season (if season1 selected, will direct to the selection method) and the arrow on the right page will go to the next season (if season15 is selected, will direct you to the redirect page and photo gallery). This method is ideal if you would like to look at seasons that are close to the selected/current seasons.

The second way includes using the season dropdown option. At the top of the left page where it says what the current season is, you can simply click on either the word or the dropdown arrow. It will open the dropdown menu, which will allow you to select your season. This way is ideal if you want to view a later season or skip seasons you are viewing.

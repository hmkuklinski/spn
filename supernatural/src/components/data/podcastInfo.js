        desc:"In 2005, Sam and Dean Winchester set off on a road trip that would save the world and change television.\nFor fifteen seasons and three hundred and twenty-seven episodes, the CW's Supernatural, created by Eric Kripke, took audiences on a wild ride of family, fate, and faith with a rocking soundtrack and a seriously cool car.

Produced by Story Mill Media, this podcast isn’t just a rewatch—it’s a weekly invitation to revisit, reflect, and rediscover the magic of Supernatural through a fresh, insider perspective. Whether you're a longtime fan or just starting the journey, there's always room to join the family.",

            {id:1, name:"Rob Benedict", imgsrc:"/assets/beyond/rb.png", role:"Prophet Chuck Shirley and God", bg:"Rob Benedict is best known to Supernatural fans for his portrayal of Chuck Shurley, a reclusive prophet who was later revealed to be God. First appearing in season 4, Rob brought a unique mix of vulnerability, humor, and quiet intensity to the role, which evolved from comic relief to a central, godlike force by the end of the series. Outside of the show, Rob is also a talented musician, fronting the band Louden Swain, which often performs at Supernatural conventions."}, 
            {id:2, name:"Richard Speight Jr.", imgsrc:"/assets/beyond/rsj.jpg", role:"\"The Trickster\" and Gabriel", bg:"Richard Speight Jr. played the Trickster, later revealed to be the archangel Gabriel, bringing a sharp wit, playful charisma, and layered emotional depth to the role. First appearing in season 2, Richard quickly became a fan favorite for his ability to balance humor with tragedy, especially in later episodes that explored Gabriel's complex backstory. Beyond acting, Richard became a prolific director on Supernatural, starting in season 11 with the episode “Just My Imagination.”"}
